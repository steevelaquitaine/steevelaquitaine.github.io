			<h1>My teaching statement</h1>

      <p>At the core, teaching is about helping students learn and think critically about 
      a discipline’s knowledge, recognize its central problems and design practical approaches 
      to solve them. I taught a diverse group of students, in and out of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
      to evaluate and build knowledge they used to solve conceptual and practical problems. This diversity 
      was a major challenge which compelled the use of different teaching approaches and delivery modes, 
      as I taught the Scientific Method to university undergraduates on-site, and machine learning engineering 
        to data scientists, onsite and online. Although the methods and materials I used differed, the common 
        thread of my teaching was to keep students focused and interested via actively learning to collaborate 
        on a project in small groups.</p>
      
<p>As a teaching assistant in Scientific Methodology for two years, for freshmen and sophomores in Biology at 
  Bordeaux University, I combined seminar talks, lab assignments and collaborative research projects to teach 
  a class of 20 students to reason scientifically. While achieving that goal was predicated on learning basic 
  knowledge in Biology, we made it a priority to interleave passive lectures and reading assignments with weekly 
  active research in groups on a topic students chose. I created small four-person groups within which students 
  frequently exchanged, negotiating their topic, an article’s relevance and task delegation, during weekly visits 
  I supervised at the library. Our syllabus conveyed clear common expectations about the course’s goals, but as 
  maturity gaps makes reaching the same goals harder for weakest students, we relied on a questionnaire to maximize 
  shared interests and maturity levels within groups. This enabled us to orient the weak groups toward easy topics, 
  freeing time to explain difficult concepts. We structured the course around a series of four intermediate learning 
  outcomes and it ended with two capstone outcomes. To force students to take ownership of their learning, we first 
  used an individual assignment, which was to take, review and organize notes during a seminar talk I gave on my 
  PhD’s work and deliver them in writing. Each group then chose, broke down the logic and justified the importance 
  of research articles, during in-class discussions. Understanding the logic of a paper helped them summarize an 
  article and deliver it in a written abstract. They performed a lab experiment in Biochemistry and described it 
  in a written lab report. The two final assignments were to compose a literature review, delivered in a written 
  report, and to defend that review in an oral presentation illustrated with visual slides and in a Q&A session. 
  Allowing students to choose their research topic freely motivated them to engage in class, but I also created 
  opportunities for them to explain their research to other groups, as experts, in their own words. I sprinkled 
  reflections, raised questions and incentivized engagement with positive feedbacks and extra credits. This helped 
  quickly identify misconceptions and roadblocks. The course’s highlight was when I had them visit my laboratory 
  and observe while I performed an experiment with monkeys, which made research very concrete to them. </p>
      
<p>I taught three teams of data scientists to use practical machine learning engineering skills, as a lead instructor 
  in the banking sector, which required a different type of interactions with students, a palette of online teaching 
  materials together with strong planning and team coordination skills. The data scientists came from different 
  business departments, with different business cultures and missions, and had different business and engineering 
  skills. The COVID-19 pandemic also required swift adjustment to virtualized teaching, so I designed the course 
  so that I could teach on-site and online. The central learning goal was to be able to develop and deploy 
  reproducible and maintainable machine learning software, which are also critical skills in research. 
  I faced two major challenges which were new to me: keep students motivated in the virtual setting and satisfy the 
  full-time working professionals’ tight allocated time to learn new skills, I had to plan the delivery of a palette 
  of materials that included slide presentations, shared code repositories, open-source software, to develop a website 
  with documentations and troubleshooting, setup an issue tracking software to ensure prompt and continuous support 
  from the TAs that I coordinated. The goal was to enable students to prepare and review courses, while requiring minimal 
  practice and downtime from their side.  I delivered upcoming sessions’ slides, coding exercises directly embedded in 
  the software to deploy and questions days in advance. At that career stage, students had acquired extensive collaborative 
  skills and I channeled discussions in which they could contribute their strong expertise and in which their diverse 
  educational backgrounds enable all to discover new thinking frameworks, approaches and skills to solve problems, 
  fostering mutual growth.  Students’ high satisfaction was attested by course rating consistently above 9/10.</p> 
      
<p>Mentoring requires more personal interactions, one-to-one exchanges, strong empathetic and listening skills and a genuine interest in students’ experience and goals. I started practicing these skills when I was a university freshman as I tutored high school students in Biology. I also had the opportunity to mentor several master's students in Neurosciences and Mathematics during my PhD and during my postdoc at Stanford. As a lead data scientist, I oversaw the supervision and mentoring of junior and senior data scientists to raise their maturity levels. It is personally satisfying to know that one of my students in Scientific Methodology is today a postdoctoral researcher in paleoclimatic reconstruction and that one of my senior data scientists now supervises his own team. </p>
