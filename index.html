			<h1>My research</h1>

			<p><strong>Focus:</strong> I study how neural networks integrate context with sensory information to inform decision-making, within and across brain regions, by combining high density recording & fMRI techniques, psychophysics, data-constrained computational modeling. My research focuses on the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How does the brain efficiently encode continuously changing external sensory inputs and internal context in the dynamic activity of cortical neural population? 
				<li>How are they abstracted into internal models that inform decision-making? 
				<li>Are they fused in cortical networks? If yes, via what computations? 
				<li>How does the cortical circuitry's sparse, structured connectivity, constrain its representational and computational capacity? 
				<li>What can we learn from such constrains on the limitations of animal perception and decision-making?			
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>Approach:</strong> I combine system neuroscience neural recording techniques, such as extracellular electrophysiology in rodents and fMRI in humans, with psychophysical experiments, to jointly measure neural population activity and behavior and I use 
decision theoretic and neural network models to link them. To thoroughly describe the dynamic computations reflected in the recorded activity, I analyse how neural network connectivity pattern shapes and constrains the representational and computational capacity of recurrent neural network models of the cortical microcircuit at different levels of biophysical detail. To do so I use mathematical tools from linear dynamical system theory and machine learning techniques of dimensionality reduction. High-density neuropixels multi-unit recordings combined with machine learning-driven progress
in spike sorting, have reduced sampling biases, such as the preferential selection of task-responsive neurons. Yet the amount and types of sorting biases that limit our ability to measure the true population activity are unclear. I use biophysically-detailed models of the neocortical microcircuit to characterize and quantify spike sorting biases and improve spike sorting algorithms.  </p>
							
			<p><strong>Some context:</strong> I currently lead research as a postdoc in Michael Reimann's lab at the Blue Brain Project, EPFL. I create experimental, computational approaches and machine learning tools to analyse stimulus and context encoding in large-scale biophysically-detailed simulations of the entire primary somatosensory cortex of rodents, relying on the computing powers of high-performance clusters and graphical processing units (GPU). Before joining the Blue Brain Project, I worked with Prof. Justin Gardner at Stanford University, where I used psychophysics, fMRI, and 
				Bayesian modeling to link human visual choices with cortical activity. I studied Computational Neuroscience at the University of Bordeaux, France, where 
				I obtained my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Thomas Boraud. During my PhD, I performed multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings in the Basal Ganglia of primates 
				trained to perform a stochastically rewarded two-choice task. I specialized in developing 
				statistical approaches and reinforcement learning models 
				to link the animal choices with the measured MEA spiking activity. I found that choices are not always motivated by reward 
				but are sometimes entirely driven by task contextual cues. I pursued this research first at the Riken Brain Science Institute in Japan, 
				then at Stanford University. During this time, I honed my skills in machine learning and statistical decision modeling and acquired 
				new skills in fMRI to link human decision-making, prior experience, and cortical activity. 
				
				I then spent a brief period in industry 
				working as a Lead Data Scientist where I perfected my machine learning engineering skills. I currently also pursue research as a visiting 
				scholar at KU Leuven, where I investigate how artificial networks can self-organize to represent information efficiently and make adaptive decisions in collaboration with Prof. Cees Van Leeuwen. <p>
